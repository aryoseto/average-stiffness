# average-stiffness

## Introduction
This python script is to do the averaging of linearised pile stiffness produced by SPLICE. It produces both averaging in pile basis and in global basis. 


## Updates
17 Oct 2019 : Refine the reading process by giving the ability to define the start of the pile numbering, instead of just a number of pile.
